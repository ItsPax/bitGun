# bitGun

A codeforces test suite. Still building, and as such a lot of design decisions are not made.
##todo
- _next:_ load the file using the editor specified
- build an editor for _config.yml_
- if the program compiles, push the input into the program for all test cases
- output the program output from above into a file
- compare the files and store somewhere
- find a solution to do this periodically

##what's done for far
- have a solution for building a directory for contests specified
- touches and creates the file with the specified extension
- grabbed the input and output data using bs4 from codeforces
- yaml is being used as a config solution
